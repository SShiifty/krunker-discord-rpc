# krunker-discord-rpc
Show your discord friends how are you doing in your krunker match!

# Installation:
To install this, you will need to install "[ViolentMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)" first in google chrome (I haven't tested other browsers yet)
**PLEASE ONLY USE VIOLENTMONKEY, I TRIED USING TAMPERMONKEY AND IT DIDN'T WORK.**

You will also need to run the node program (index.js) inside the "server" folder. And add the userscript located inside the "scripts" folder. Thanks :)
